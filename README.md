# Rancid Tomatillos Microservice starter 

This is a starter repository you will use to create your Rancid Tomatillos solo iterations.

You will update the `server.js` file with your new endpoints.

## Set Up

If you haven't already installed Nodemon globally on your computer, run the following script: `$ npm install -g nodemon`

This allows you to hot-reload the server as your are developing (rather than needing to kill the server and restart every time you make a change).

1. Clone down this repo.
1. Change into the repo and install dependencies.
1. To run the server while actively developing (when you need hot reloading), use the start script `$ npm run dev`.
1. To run the server without needing hot reloading, use the start script `$ npm start`.
